# First-Python-Project
My first console application in python

This program is a basic class registration console application written in python.

The program contains a student and course class that create student and course objects that can be saved to JSON.

This program allows users to:

1. add students to a JSON database.
2. view their details.
3. add classes to the same DB.
4. view the classes.
5. enroll students in classes.
6. view the total credits a student has overall.
7. Save and load the information

It is very basic and I tried to keep it clean and comment it appropriately.
